Create countdown clock for sale products. This plugin help you to increase CRT.

== Description ==
This Woocommerce countdown plugin makes site customers look forward to the launch. It creates the “I can’t wait!” feeling that you want your customer to buy.

Countdown times really work for conversions. It is human nature to want to wait and think about it before making a purchase, but it is also human nature to take action if we think that the offer is going to expire! That is why these timers convert so well!
